# Hello There! 👋

<br />

Hi, I’m **LucasNBS** from Pau dos Ferros, RN, Brazil.

I graduated from high school as an Informatics Technician at IFRN – Campus Pau dos Ferros, where I am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development.

I have been working as a Web Developer since 2022, when I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, I have worked with both front end and back end technologies, including Python, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Django, and Django REST Framework.

Throughout my journey, I have learned how to work in teams, write clear, efficient, and maintainable code, and design complex systems in a strategic way.

I aim to work on innovative, impactful projects and continue developing my skills in system design and leadership. My long-term objective is to work as a Tech Lead, contributing to both technical excellence and team direction.
